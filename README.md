# ArtGallery

## Description
- I challenged myself in recreating a complex front-end experience using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- I have created a responsive single page website with HTML, Vanilla JS and CSS without any other external libraries such as Bootstrap.
- As I was looking for an inspiration to build a website with a nice design, I have took inspiration from an another website that I have liked it very much.

## Live Demo
